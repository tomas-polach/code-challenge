# Code Challenge

## Task:

Implement two functions in [src/index.js](src/index.js):
- `getAandB` should return the concatenated string from the results of `getA` and `getB`
- `getBandC` should return the concatenated string from the results of `getB` and `getC`

## Requirements:

- getA, getB, getC should be cached for 490 ms upon request (not upon response)
- Tests at [src/index.test.js](src/index.test.js) should be successful
- Test code coverage should be at 100%. Add tests if needed

## Test:

1. `npm install`
2. `npm test`
